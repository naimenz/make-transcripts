# Transcript from audio
Quick repo to make transcripts based on podcast audio.

# Gotchas

- You need to use an old version of `speechbrain` for compatibility with `pyannote`.
- You need to install `torch` and `openai-whisper` separately (and maybe something else)?

# TODOs

- Add ability to change speaker names after the fact
- Improve grouping of segments by speaker
    - Both while processing audio and when displaying transcript
- Make it easier to copy-paste out
- Make it easier to use for non-technical people
- Make it easier to run in colab
